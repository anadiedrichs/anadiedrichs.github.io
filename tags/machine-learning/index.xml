      <description>The aim of this project is to use environmental &amp;amp; agronomic information to build a dataset for: 1) predicting frost events, 2) Selecting the sensor locations most significative for frost events prediction 3) Understand the impact of temperature, humidity and other environmental factors in the vineyard yield forecasting system.

      <description>Farmers can lose everything in a couple of hours In 2013, 85% of the peach production in the Mendoza region (Argentina) was lost because of frost. Because less fruit was produced in the region, 600.000 less work days were needed to process the harvest between November 2013 and March 2014, a reduction in work force of 10.600 people. Across the Mendoza region, frost has caused a loss of revenue of 950 million Argentine pesos roughly 100 million USD in the peach business alone.</description>
